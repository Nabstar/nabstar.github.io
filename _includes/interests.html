				 <p class="title"> Tinkering with Electronics </p>
         <p>
            Ever since I grew up as a child I was facinated with electronics "My God how on earth is such a device possible speak through a device all of a sudden it does what you want" I said to myself that's power how can I design such a device I like it.
         </p>

			  <li>
				  <p class="title"> Raspberry pi </p>
          <p>
            I've been an enthusiastic tinkerer as teenager - but only as an adult am I able to afford the higher-quality devices. I like to modify existing kits to innovate new concepts, or to an extend add some instrumentation to existing creation.

            Nowadays with prototyping boards available be it the arduino, PI, et-al there's an unlimited possibilities to do almost anything with them.

				  <p class="title"> Software </p>
          <p>
            If I could remember correctly, the first line of code I wrote was in BASIC old school programming language on a pentium desktop pc it was an exciting experience back then feeling like a hero by printing the text "hello" to the screen.

            <p>
              Gradually, I became thirsty on what I can do with BASIC not knowing that its such a limited language that you can only do little with.
